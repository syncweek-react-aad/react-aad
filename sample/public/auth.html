<!--
  A blank html helper file for authentication redirects.

  If using the popup authentication method, point the redirectUrl to this file for a more performant authentication.
  Rather than the authentication popup loading the entire page in an iframe and downloading scripts/css twice,
  the MSAL library will use this blank HTML file as a valid route on the domain to store items in cache and deal
  with cookies.

  If not using the popup authentication method, this file can still be used for refresh tokens, where the file will be loaded
  in the refresh iframe rather than reloading your entire site.
